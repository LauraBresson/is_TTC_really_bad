Analysis of gaps and delays in TTC

In this repo, I'll be analyzing the gaps and delays on the Toronto Transit Commission (TTC) buses, streetcars and subway.
At first, a notebook will be created for each service for the data cleaning part of the project. 
- cleaning_subway.ipynb
- cleaning_buses.ipynb
- cleaning_streetcars.ipynb 

After data cleaning is complete, then 3 new notebooks will be created for the data analysis part of the project.
- analysis_subway.ipynb
- analysis_streetcars.ipynb
- analysis_buses.ipynb
